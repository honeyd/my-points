Example AngularFire Firebase app with authentication and limiting

## The app
* Create activities that score points
* Check off activities daily to reach your goal

## Highlights
* AngularFireAuth with Facebook, login and logout
* Builds Firebase refs with the authenticated user id in the path
* Uses angularFire and angularFireCollection references
* Sets and uses priority for querying

## What I would do if there was more time
* Ability to edit an existing activity
* Reporting
* Maintaining historical points regardless of current configuration
